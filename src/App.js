          Curate for change uses the transformative power of art to promote awareness, encourage dialogue, and <br/>
          inspire action. We seek to address issues of social justice, environmental stewardship and sustainabilityâ€”in <br/>
          creative, inspiring, and ultimately positive ways by creating on-site installations that are at once emotional, <br/>
          intellectual, and sensory.

          Art and design are manifestations of the culture from which they emanate from and we therefore seek to use <br/>
          them as a vessel for cultural exchange. We believe that promoting social awareness is a responsibility. We <br/>
          consider the act and practice of staging artistic diversity a vital means by which art and design can serve <br/>
          social progress.

          We conceive and deliver artistic, innovative and participative installations, aiming to raise awareness and <br/>
          mobilize action on social issues. For each project, we partner with a related not-for-profit organization to <br/>
          create an interconnected programme that sheds light on the issue in question. In this way, the installation <br/>
          serves as a beacon around which artists, customers and organizations can unite as a collective force for <br/> change.
